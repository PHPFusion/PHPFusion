Hello World

<h2>PHP-Fusion 9</h2>
At core - Autoloader, SEO output handling, Meta keywords for greater site indexing.

<h1>Defender</h1>

With its light weight management system, with the way you use it, the PHP-Fusion has always been uniquely immersive and easy to manage your content.With PHP-Fusion and the conventional default method introduced to every PHP Developers, we have introduced a whole new way to ensure your system stays secured.
Until now, these methods have been defined by the PHP source code developers...

For PHP-Fusion 9, we're introducing an entirely new sanitization interaction and a whole new dimension to the way we can do things.For the first time along recognising a bad string, PHP-Fusion is also recognizing its types, allowing itself to automatically handle itself against any unwanted input, while escalating the way you will experience PHP-Fusion.

This is the next generation of form validation and sanitization, enabled automatically wherever it is required system wide.The Defender works on any code that is networked within PHP-Fusion giving you shortcuts to the things you do frequently to secure your sanitization.

At the heart of the new PHP-Fusion 9, new functions are developed to react as validation sensors and fully integrated into the Defender engine which will measure the changes of
each and every input fields. These measurements are then combined with a pre-sanitized values from the sensors to provide fast, accurate and continous response and enhance itself automatically with Themes to provide beautiful form feedback. All each single process is completed within a milisecond.

The Defender, is a clear example of how applications and core software can be developed together to work in a singular experience.


<h2>PHP-Fusion Dynamics</h2>

With the introduction of Bootstrap responsive framework, a single website have been transformed to adapt and is capable to become a multi device platform.

For a truly powerful developing experience, we've developed an entirely new Dynamic field input technology deeply integrated into PHP-Fusion 9's architecture.

To produce a rich User Interface experience,  â€” we've enhanced field creation simplicity by transforming short codes into a range of responsive fields. This enables tools and interaction that have been impossibly before.

While a sophisticated field on a typical Content Management System require a developer to write ten or more lines of codes, the PHP-Fusion 9 can reach about the same in just a few words, and it can be customised just as quickly. 
This allows developer to create more distinct applications in just less than a tenth of what was required previously.

For a truly communicative experience for non developers, we have to redevelop a more powerful User Fields with PHP-Fusion Dynamics. You can configure your user registration form, without losing sense of your context, while letting you know what is needed and what to expect all though the new User Quantum Fields administration interface. While the way you'll use Dynamics is simple, the engineering behind it is some of our most advanced. 

PHP-Fusion 9 continues to transform the way we do things in a whole new scale, however invented and designed.


<h2>Notification mail templating</h2>


<h2>Theming Framework</h2>

Driving the new system's high performance, is the all new theme framework. It was specifically designed to for PHP-Fusion 9 and to meet the demands of a much larger user audience. It's simple administration interface lets you do, and see more. And it's precise configuribility allow you new form of theme editing while enhancing the capabilities of installed themes package. 

With people using PHP-Fusion in different ways, PHP-Fusion 9 is redeveloped to allow 3rd party developers to develop and design products that meet the demands of specific requirements. This is the first PHP-Fusion we've developed to feature a fully customizable administration user interface, while enhancing the capabilities of PHP-Fusion 9.

To give theme frameworks a greater level of customizability - we've completely re-engineered the official system into Infusions, redevelop all its subsystems to be deflated with hierarchy, and doubling all information ouput.
All with template support dynamically rendering unique designs and contents - It's actually the most advanced system we've made.

<h2>Geo location</h2>
Perhaps more than any other libraries we have created, we're introducing a whole new geo location support that allows you to provide a rich user experience within the software's light weight profile. The commercial grade geo location library encompassed every regions of the world enable our users to support a much larger social user base.

<h2>Database Factory</h2>
Switch between PDO and MYSQL, bridge Linux and Windows. Multiconnection to bridge PHP-Fusion with other CMS.

<h2>Multilanguage Support</h2>
UTF-8 to support asian, cryllic, and latin characters.
