You can enter a full IP, e.g. <em>123.45.67.89.</em>, or a partial IP, e.g. <em>123.45.67</em> or <em>123.45</em>.
Please note: IPv6 addresses are converted to their full length form on this site,
e.g. <em>ABCD:1234:5:6:7:8:9:FF</em> will be shown as <em>ABCD:1234:0005:0006:0007:0008:0009:00FF</em>.
Mixed IP addresses (those contain both IPv6 and IPv4 part) will not be checked for partial match.
<br /><br />
Entering an email address will prevent members from registering using that address.
You can enter a full email address, e.g. <em>foo@bar.com</em>, or an email domain, e.g. <em>bar.com</em>.<br /><br />
