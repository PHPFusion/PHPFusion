PHP-Fusion is a light-weight open-source content management system (CMS) written and developed by Nick Jones (also known as Digitanium) in PHP. It uses a MySQL database to store a web site's content and comes with a simple but comprehensive administration system. PHP-Fusion includes features common in many other CMS packages.

PHP-Fusion offers users the opportunity to expand the standard packages with so-called "infusions". These infusions can be easily uploaded, installed, and managed. There are a lot of infusions available, a reasonable amount has also been checked to work with PHP-Fusion and may thus be found in the official PHP-Fusion Mods Database. Next to infusions, there are mods, which mostly alter core code, and panels, which appear on either one of the side bars. These are both also widely available, and checked and posted in the PHP-Fusion Mods Database.
PHP-Fusion also offers to create themes and use them on their web site, without much hard work. There are two files, theme.php and styles.css, in which most of the theme can be defined and altered.
